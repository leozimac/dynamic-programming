# Dynamic-programming

Can be used to solve two types of problems:
- Combinatoric, and
- Optmization problems.

We break the problem into small problems, then we find the smallest problem to solve.

## Combinatoric
These problems ends with the question: "How many?". The end goal is to count something.

## Optimization
Optimization problems have the goal of minimizing or maximizing some function.

## Steps to solve a Dynamic problem:
1. Define the objective function.
2. Identify base/edge cases.
3. Recurrence relation. Is the transiction function of one subproblem to another.
4. Order of computation. The order each subproblem are solved.
5. Location of the answer. Where we are looking for the answer.

There are some examples problems in this repository, along with the solution.
